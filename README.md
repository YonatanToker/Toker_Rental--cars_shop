## Toker_Rental
Cool site, didn't make it completely by myself, this one I followed a tutorial on it though I tried implementing and doing more by myself.

The reason it is scrolling up when I update searchParams is because of a bug in Next.js:

##Tools used:
Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS.
I used Rapid API for fetching data about the cars.
